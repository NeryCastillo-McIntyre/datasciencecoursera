# “Hello World”
### a poem by Dan Coppersmith


I am amazing

Incredible me

Celebrating the being

I choose to be


I’m uniquely spectacular

I am one of a kind

Creativity oozes

From my heart and mind


I’m stupendous, tremendous

I stand out from the crowd

I do things

That aren’t allowed


I’m inspired, desired

I am wonderfully weird

I am unbridled passion

I am highly revered


I’m outrageous, contagious

I am daring and bold

I am honored and cherished

I’m a treasure to hold


I am gifted, uplifted

I am endlessly blessed

I am sought out

For the skills I possess


I’m delightful, insightful

I am loved and adored

I live a charmed live

I’m renewed and restored


I am grateful, elateful

I am centered and wise

I am wealthy and worthy

I am God in disguise


I declare my brilliance

It won’t be denied

The world cries out

For what I provide


I am powerful, masterful

I am focused and clear

Life beams brighter

Because I am here


I am blazing, amazing

I can’t be contained

I’m glorious, fabulous

Radiant flame


I choose to exude

All this and much more

My wings are spread

Watch me soar!
